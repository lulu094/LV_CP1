Create a 3x3 board filled with empty spaces

Repeat these steps while the game is not over:

    Show the current board to the player

    Player 1 chooses a row between 0 and 2  
    Player 1 chooses a column between 0 and 2

    If the chosen spot is empty  
        Place an O in that spot  
    Else  
        Tell the player the spot is taken  
        Ask the player to choose again

    If the board still has empty spots  
        Computer chooses a random row and column between 0 and 2  
        If the spot is empty  
            Place an X in that spot  
        Else  
            Keep choosing until an empty spot is found

    Check if player 1 has three O's in a row, column, or diagonal  
    If yes  
        Print "You win!"  
        Add 1 to player1_score  
        End the game loop

    Check if player 2 has three X's in a row, column, or diagonal  
    If yes  
        Print "You lost!"  
        Add 1 to player2_score  
        End the game loop

    If the board is full and no one has won  
        Print "It's a tie!"  
        End the game loop

After the game ends  
Print "Game Over"  
Print "Your score is" followed by player1_score  
Print "Computer score is" followed by player2_score

Ask the player if they want to play again  
If the player says yes  
    Reset the board to empty  
    Repeat the game loop  
Else  
    Print "Thanks for playing"  
    End the game
