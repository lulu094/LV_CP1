# LV - 2nd Caesar Cipher
# CS1400 A - Caesar Cipher Encoder and Decoder

# Access to numbers using ord() and chr()
# ord() = get ASCII number for a character
# chr() = get character from a number
# Combined with a for loop to process each character




# 1. Define encode() function: shift each letter forward by given amount.
# 2. Define decode() function: shift each letter backward by given amount.
# 3. Use for loop + ord()/chr() to convert and shift letters.
# 4. Ask user for inputs and print encoded/decoded message.
